# cf-worker-redmine-replacement

A self-hostable, Redmine-style project / issue management app that runs entirely on
**Cloudflare Workers**, built with **TanStack Start** (SSR + file-based routing) and
**TanStack Router**, backed by **Cloudflare D1** (SQLite), **R2** (file attachments),
and **KV** (session revocation).

> Deploy a single Worker, get projects · issues · time tracking · gantt · roadmap ·
> wiki · attachments · members · permissions · activity feed · search — all without
> running a server.

## Status

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| Schema + Drizzle + migrations | ✅ stable |
| Server-function **impls** (auth, projects, issues, members, versions, categories, time-entries, wiki, attachments, activities, search) | ✅ unit-tested at 100% (lines/statements/functions/branches) |
| React components (`app/components/*`) | ✅ jsdom-tested |
| Wrangler integration (D1 / KV / R2 / WebCrypto / JOSE / cookies) | ✅ exercised end-to-end inside Miniflare via `tests/workers/` |
| `createServerFn` wrappers + routes | ⚠️ written against TanStack Start 1.168 but the **SSR runtime wiring (`npm run dev` / `build` / `deploy`) has not yet been verified end-to-end**.  The wrappers are excluded from unit coverage and only proven via the wrangler smoke tests today.  Finishing the SSR wiring is its own follow-up commit. |

If you only want to consume the server-fn impls (e.g. wire them into Hono on a
Worker, or use them in scripts), you can do so today — they are pure functions
of `(db, ...)`.

## Why

Redmine is great but feels heavy: Ruby + Passenger + Postgres/MySQL + Apache, plus
SMTP, cron jobs, file storage… This project squeezes the same model into one
edge-deployed Worker. No servers to patch, no database backups to schedule (D1
handles it), no S3 to wire up (R2 is a binding).

## Feature parity

| Module           | Status |
|------------------|--------|
| Projects (CRUD, hierarchy, public/private) | ✅ |
| Issues with tracker / status / priority / assignee / category / version / parent | ✅ |
| Issue notes (markdown) + audit-trail journal | ✅ |
| Watchers                                   | ✅ |
| Time tracking with activities + filters    | ✅ |
| Roadmap (versions with % closed)           | ✅ |
| Gantt chart (SVG)                          | ✅ |
| Wiki (markdown, revisions, per-project)    | ✅ |
| Files / attachments (R2)                   | ✅ |
| Activity feed (global + per project)       | ✅ |
| Search (issues + wiki)                     | ✅ |
| Roles & permissions (Manager / Developer / Reporter, customisable) | ✅ |
| Auth: email + password (PBKDF2) + GitHub OAuth | ✅ |
| Admin: user list, lock/unlock, promote     | ✅ |
| Per-project module toggles                 | ✅ |

## Getting started

### 0. Prerequisites
- Node ≥ 20 (developed on Node 26)
- A Cloudflare account with Workers, D1, R2 and KV enabled
- `npx wrangler login`

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allenlabs/cf-worker-redmine-replacement.git
cd cf-worker-redmine-replacement
npm install         # .npmrc sets legacy-peer-deps for the TanStack Start beta range
```

### 2. Run the test suite

```bash
npm run test            # all 3 projects (node + jsdom + workers / miniflare)
npm run test:coverage   # node + jsdom with v8 coverage + 100% thresholds
npm run test:workers    # workers project only (miniflare D1/KV/R2)
```

Current run: **198 tests** across 22 files, **100% lines / statements /
functions / branches**.

### 3. Create Cloudflare resources

```bash
wrangler d1 create redmine
wrangler kv namespace create SESSION_KV
wrangler r2 bucket create cf-redmine-files
# copy the printed ids into wrangler.toml
```

### 4. Local secrets

```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
# at minimum set JWT_SECRET
```

### 5. Migrate + seed

```bash
npm run db:migrate:local
npm run db:seed:local
```

### 6. Dev / Deploy

> ⚠️ **Not yet verified end-to-end.**  The SSR runtime entry (`app/client.tsx`,
> `app/ssr.tsx`) targets TanStack Start 1.168 but has not been booted in dev
> mode by the maintainer.  Use [`npm run test:workers`](#2-run-the-test-suite)
> to validate Cloudflare bindings + auth flow today.

```bash
npm run dev             # vite dev (TODO: verify)
npm run build           # vite build (TODO: verify)
npm run deploy          # build + wrangler deploy (TODO: verify)
```

---

## GitHub OAuth setup (optional)

1. <https://github.com/settings/developers> → New OAuth App
2. **Authorization callback URL:** `{PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/oauth/github/callback`
3. Copy the Client ID + Secret, set them with `wrangler secret put …`
4. The "Sign in with GitHub" button appears on `/login` automatically.

On first GitHub login, an account is created using the GitHub `login` and primary
verified email. Subsequent logins match by GitHub ID first, then by email.

```

## Permissions model

Inspired by Redmine. Each role has a JSON `permissions` array; see
`drizzle/seed.sql` for the default Manager / Developer / Reporter sets, and
`app/lib/permissions.ts` for the full enum. The server-side `requirePermission`
helper enforces them on every mutating server function.

Admins (users with `admin = 1`) bypass all per-project checks.

## Notes / known limitations

- The Gantt is read-only SVG (no drag-resize) — keeps the bundle tiny.
- Email notifications are intentionally omitted (no SMTP on the edge); plug in
  Cloudflare Email Routing or Postmark/Resend via a queue if you need them.
- Custom fields are not implemented yet (would slot in via a small extra table).
- See `Status` table above for what's verified vs still on the TODO list.
