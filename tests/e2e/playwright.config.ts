/**
 * Playwright config for end-to-end tests against deployed
 * *.allen.company workers.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - Single worker.  The tests share one admin account and write rows that
 *     get cleaned up at teardown — concurrent runs would race on tag-based
 *     teardown.
 *   - Retries=1 because deployed workers occasionally cold-start.
 *   - globalSetup logs in once and writes storageState to .auth/state.json.
 *   - globalTeardown runs cleanup.ts regardless of test outcome.
 *   - HTML report is suppressed (just text on failure) so unattended runs
 *     don't pop a browser.
